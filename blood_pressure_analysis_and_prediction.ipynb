    "# Blood Pressure Analysis and Prediction\n",
    "## Josh McComack\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "I wish to investigate the feasibility of predicting systolic and diastolic blood pressure based on the [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/national-health-and-nutrition-examination-survey/home) (NHANES) data set from 2013-2014 found on kaggle.com. The primary questions I wish to answer are:\n",
    "1. Which variables from the survey are most predictive empirically and do they correspond to the what mainstream literature identifies as key factors in blood pressure levels?\n",
    "2. Comparing scikit-learn’s SGDRegressor, MultiTaskLasso, and RandomForestRegressor, which regression model offers the best predictions on this data set?\n",
    "3. Does the best model perform well enough to serve as a possible supplementary or alternative way of “measuring” blood pressure?\n"
